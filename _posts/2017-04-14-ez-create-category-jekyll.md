Pretext: I am currently using [ThinkSpace](http://github.com/heiswayi/thinkspace) theme, it's good and minimalistic theme that grouped & sorted your post by Year and Date. It's good on one theme blog but not for multi categories blog. 

Good things, it's already there and need no extra plugin. Just some *hack*. ;)
